### Hi there, my name is Ferran ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Developer with a solid foundation in C and C++. After 4 years working as a Motion Designer I decided to try a new role as Software Developer. 

I'm currently studying at 42 Barcelona, a project-oriented computer science school distinguished for its unique peer-to-peer learning method, where I was able to improve on soft skills like communication, teamwork, self-learning, and critical thinking.
